## About me
Hi! I'm [Vegard Beyer](vegardbeyer.de/). Communication designer, climate campaigner with a focus on movement strategy, co-founder of [Future Matters Project](https://futuremattersproject.org/). I spend most of my time studying how movements become successful and applying the insights in today's climate movements. 

Studying communication design, I became critical of the role advertising plays in the world. I started reading research on global inequality and ecological destruction. By visiting a few conferences, I stumbled into environmental science networks. I [graduated](https://vegardbeyer.de/leitfaden) on effective communication strategies in the context of environmental crises, in cooperation with the Club of Rome. Since then I've written, taught and advised on communications & movement strategy, e.g. for Sustainability Week Zurich, FFF, Scientists for Future, [SchwarmForFuture](https://schwarmforfuture.net/), Extinction Rebellion (XR), and others. I co-founded FFF Germany's federal working group on citizen lobbying in early 2019 and left it once I was unnecessary.

## About these notes
These notes are mostly written for myself: they’re how I "think by writing". I share them publicly because other have inspired me to [Work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) and [The only way to learn in public is to build in public](https://www.mentalnodes.com/the-only-way-to-learn-in-public-is-to-build-in-public)). If anything I've written is confusing or incomplete, that’s probably because I didn’t write it for you. There’s no index: you’ll need to just follow links that interest you, from idea to idea.
